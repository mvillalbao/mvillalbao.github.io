Hello there, thank you for stopping by!

I'm a Consultant for Data Analysis in Impact Evaluations of Fiscal Programs (PEC) at the <a href="https://www.iadb.org/en" target="_blank">Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)</a>. Previously, I have worked as a research assistant to <a href="https://masonkorea.gmu.edu/people/ecastrom" target="_blank">Edgar Castro</a> (George Mason University Korea), and <a href="https://ciup.up.edu.pe/investigadores/manuel-barron/" target="_blank">Manuel Barron</a> (Universidad del Pacífico). 

As a researcher I have a keen interest in topics of development economics, machine learning, and political economy.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Economics from <a href="https://up.edu.pe/" target="_blank">Universidad del Pacífico</a>, where my thesis, advised by professors <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=es&user=Ek1a88wAAAAJ" target="_blank">Alberto Chong</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=kyh1aqwAAAAJ&hl=es" target="_blank">Edgar Castro</a>, focused on <a href="/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">evaluating the impact of COVID-19 policies on the efficiency of public procurement</a>. This work was recognized and published as one of the top undergraduate theses in an annual economic research compilation by Universidad del Pacífico.
